# Munich Airport "Franz Josef Strau√ü" in the south of Germany.

Second hub of Lufthansa, offering many international and intercontinental routes.

## Already working:
- most SIDs exist
- various transitions and approach waypoints
- real airspaces
- pre-covid airlines

## TODOs, help wanted!
- general aviation traffic missing, maybe government traffic
- special cargo traffic missing, for example antonovs
- airline traffic frequency balance probably not ideal
- check if airspace height restrictions make sense
- check if some SIDs can be removed because they are barely used in real life
- runway configs missing
- check if arrival entry directions make sense, same for descent altitude
