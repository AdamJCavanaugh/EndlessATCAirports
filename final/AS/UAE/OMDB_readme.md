Endless ATC Dubai CTA v1.1 by Zac Kaplowitz

AIRAC 2102

v1.1 only covers OMDB (Dubai International Airport) in the 30 configuration. The 12 configuration is not yet included. Sharjah and Al Maktoum are not yet included. The Minhad restricted airspace is not yet included.

30L is for arrivals, 30R is for departures. The platform altitude for 30L is 2000 feet. The platform altitude for 30R is 3000 feet. All departures maintain initially 4000ft. Airspace from 1500-FL150.

D-APO is now implemented. With skill set to 12 or above, 30R will open for arrivals as well as departures. 30R arrivals must still maintain separation from 30L arrivals and must establish at 3000 feet.

On initial contact, arriving aircraft should be cleared for the arrival.

The minimum separation in the CTA is 3nm. The minimum separation on the same localiser is 2.5nm. Aircraft on the same SID must be handed off to UAE Radar with at least 8nm in trail.

For the purposes of separation, the 30L and 30R localisers are considered to be the same localiser.

Even altitudes are used for arrivals and odd altitudes for departures. This is ignored below 4000ft, as 3000ft is used to separate arrivals more efficiently.

Arrival procedures
Speeds

CTA entry - 230 knots
Turning downwind on the IMPED3C arrival - 210 knots
Passing the threshold on the downwind leg - 190 knots
Until 10nm - 190 knots
After 10nm - 160 knots

---------------------------------------------------------

Arrival procedures
IMPED3C

Passing IMPED, direct ULDOT may be given for a straight-in approach. From the upwind leg, directs may be given to GIRGO, VELAR or RIDEV.
6000 feet until crossing DB515, then not below 4000 feet until established on downwind, then as required.

---------------------------------------------------------

Arrival procedures
LORID4D

If there are no ANVIX departures, direct DB533 is permitted once past ORGUR. Directs to DB528 or RARPI are permitted once past EMOPO.
10000 feet until crossing ORGUR, then 8000 feet until crossing DB533, then 6000 feet, then as required.

---------------------------------------------------------

Arrival procedures
PUVAL5C

If there are no IVURO departures, direct GIRGO/VELAR/RIDEV may be given.
10000ft until clear of IVURO departures, then 8000 feet, then 6000 feet, then as required.

---------------------------------------------------------

Arrival procedures
VUTEB3D

No direct routings permitted.
8000 feet until PATID, then 6000 feet until clear of departing traffic, then 4000 feet until clear of 30L localiser, then as required.

Departure procedures
Separation minima

Aircraft on the same SID must be handed off to UAE Radar 8nm in trail or greater. Aircraft entering the Muscat FIR (those on ANVIX and IVURO departures) must be separated by 20nm.
