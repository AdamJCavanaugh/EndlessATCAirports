  !Important: This is a such simpler version develop for Mobile EATC player.
  The folder going to store in your phone is: `\\Android\data\com.dirgtrats.endlessatc\files`

This is an implementation of the Hong Kong FIR and TMA for [Endless ATC](https://steamcommunity.com/app/666610) featuring `VHHH` Hong Kong International Airport. The airspace ceiling is FL250.
This Map ONLY include Hong Kong Terminal Control Area and some Extended Section on Zhuhai TCA.

  

Based upon AIP Hong Kong 11/20 (2020 11th Version) . The SIDs and STARs may not be 100% accurate to real life but should be reasonably accurate reflecting daytime IMC conditions. All traffic are designed to fly RNAV(GNSS) and ILS APCH. The Northern Boundary data between VHHK FIR and ZGZU FIR are from Basic Law Instrument 11.

  

The border of the map has included VHHH TMA, VMMC ATZ, ZGGG FIR and ZGZUTM04 TCA and playable range only include VHHH TMA and VMMC ATZ due to the size of FIR are too big to play.

Information of Hong Kong TMA, Transition Altitude (TA) shall be 9000ft and Transition Level (TFL) shall be FL110 (QNH980+), FL120 (QNH979-). Do not assign FL100! Live QNH can be retrieved at [ATIS](https://atis.cad.gov.hk/ATIS/ATISweb/atis.php) by CADHK.

  

STARs are implemented as approach transitions. To activate an approach, an aircraft must be flying direct to an applicable fix, then the APP button can be activated. Multiple approaches may be available from a fix. Press the APP button again before issuing the approach clearance (do not long press) will select the next approach available from that fix. If the aircraft is already on an approach from that fix, you will need to cancel the approach clearance first before issuing another approach clearance.

  

Inside VHHK FIR have 4 Airports, `VHHH`, `VHHX`, `VHSK` and `VMMC`. Further Information will be included below.

  

## Airports

  

### `VHHH` Hong Kong International Airport

The main airport of this sector. Which is also only airport included in current verison *v1.0*. HKIA is also the only International Airport had two runway within FIR. All departures and arrivals come from or to Southern, Eastern and Western only due the packed Airspace with nearby Guangzhou FIR and Shenzhen Airport approach route.

  

There is custom traffic for `VHHH`. Although it is NOT reliable and only designed for the hub airline callsign to show up. *For Government / HKG, are usually operating Helicopters and Small Planes, I had included C172 for its slow purpose. Please be alert with it as it can't follow the speed with airliner.

  

All visible fixes on the map have a defined hold including many fixes along the STARs but excluded SMT. Standard Missed Approach Route will be included in later versions.

  

#### Arrival STARS

-  `ABBEY`: Eastern route from RCAA (Taipei) FIR, ZGZU (Guanzhou) FIR and ZSHA (Shanghai) FIR

-  `SIERA`: Northern route from ZGZU (Guangzhou) FIR

  

#### Departure SID

-`BEKOL`: Northern Route, No TTR, No Handoff below S0690 / F226.

-`LAKES`: Northeast Route, TTR V1/V13, Handoff at F230

-`OCEAN`: Eastern Route, TTR V2/V3/V4/V5, Handoff at F250

#### Runway (Suffix for SID/STAR)

- 07R (A)

- 25L (B)

- 07L (C) *Use (A) for STAR

- 25R (D) *Use (B) for STAR

  

#### Operations

Due to Complication of airspace, all traffic are suggested to follow STAR approach and Do not assign holding at / under 15+ inbound within 30 minutes.

**For Runway 07:**

  

- TD VOR is a collision point between Departure SID and Arrival STAR:

- Departure maintain 7000ft or below

- Arrival maintain 9000ft or above

  

**Operations:**

  
- Northern Runway 07L/25R is the usual Arrival Runway
