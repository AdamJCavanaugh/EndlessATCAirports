Custom map for San Francisco (KSFO), Oakland (KOAK), and San Jose (KSJC).

Controlled airspace around OA and SJ is recreated.
Other restricted areas indicate regions of high terrain. The terrain around San Jose can prove somewhat limiting when 
maneuvering landing aircraft.

Three runway configurations are available:
1: KFSO land 28L/R, takeoff 1L/R 28R; KOAK land 28R 30, takeoff 28L 30; KSJC land 30L, takeoff 30R
2: As #1, except KSJC land 12R, takeoff 12L
2: As #1, KFSO land 28L, takeoff 28L/R
3: KSFO land 19L/R, takeoff 10L/R; KOAK land 10L 30, takeoff 10R 30; KSJC land 12R, takeoff 12L
Configuration 1 represents the standard configuration, used 80-85% of the time. This is the suggested configuration!
Configuration 2 is a rare alternative that has been observed, but only during quiet periods.
Configuration 3 is a bad weather scenario. Strong winds through the San Bruno Gap restrict use of runways 1L/R, while low cloud prevents simultaneous landings on 28L/R.
Configuration 4 is represents strong wind from the south/southeast.
Note that Configuration 3/4 are tricky - SF suffers bad delays when bad weather forces these configurations, due to the severe restriction in landing capacity.

SF handles the majority of international traffic, as well as short and long distance domestic traffic.
Takeoffs from runways 01L/R tend to be domestic flights.
International flights mainly use runways 28L/R
(Note that Endless ATC cannot represent these patterns at the time of writing).
Flights taking off from runways 01L/R will turn to fly direct over Oakland, and need to be instructed to take the SID once clear of conflicting traffic.
Flights to the west/south/southeast should be turned SW (Left ~220) immediately, so that they can fly on the south side of the SF/OA arrival flows.
Flights taking off from runways 10L/R will fly runway heading until instructed otherwise.

OA sees both commercial and general aviation.
Commercial flights use the south side of the airport, using runway 12/30, with short and long distance domestic flights (including Hawaii), as well as being a cargo flight hub for UPS and FedEx.
Runways 28L/R (or 10L/R) serve the general aviation side of the airport. XOJet have a private terminal on this side, and a number of executive charter airlines operate from this side.
Flights taking off from runways 30/28R will fly heading 296 until instructed otherwise.

SJ is mainly dominated by Southwest Airlines' domestic network. It also sees a large number of executive jets on a daily basis, due to its position in Silicon Valley.
Flights taking off from runway 30R will turn right heading 121. If continuing north, flights should be climbed above arriving SF/OA traffic before taking the SID.
